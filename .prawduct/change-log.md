## 2026-05-20 — R-1 + R-2: cue idempotency, scaffold cleanup CLI, compat preset_query validation

**R-1.1 — Cue push idempotency.** `ableton_arrangement(cue_create /
cue_create_batch)` gains `if_exists={"refuse", "skip"}`. Single-cue
default `"refuse"` preserves one-shot caller semantics; batch default
`"skip"` makes the planner's re-push idempotent (same-name same-position
no-ops with `skipped=true`; name mismatch refuses so rename intent goes
through `cue_rename` explicitly). `plan_push_cue_points` emits
`if_exists="skip"` so re-pushing the same DB into a Live set that
already has the cues no-ops the second time, instead of the prior
"halt with `a cue already exists at position_beats=0.0` on every cue."

**R-1.2 — Default-scaffold cleanup CLI.** `push_cli
cleanup-default-scaffold <session_id>` replaces the 6+ hand-issued
`ableton_track/return(action='delete')` calls W18-D's detect-only path
required. Pure planner `push.plan_cleanup_default_scaffold` refuses on
non-canonical unmatched parents (user must hand-resolve "another song's
tracks") and on "would empty Live tracks" (Live's ≥1-track constraint).
CLI dispatches deletes in descending index order in-process, then
re-runs `probe_and_link` to reconcile shifted indexes.
`.claude/skills/ableton-push/SKILL.md` Step 2a now points at the
subcommand.

**R-2.1 — Compose-time preset_query validation.**
`compat.classify_preset_query()` catches the two structural traps that
hit sun-zone-done at push time: `root` not in the loader-accepted enum
(typo `'effects'` vs `'audio_effects'` — 8 push failures) and non-list
`path_prefix` (3 failures). `check_song` accepts an optional
`browser_dry_runs` map; structurally-valid preset_queries classify as
`kind_unresolvable` (0 matches), `kind_ambiguous` (2+ matches),
`preset_query_unverified` (no dry-runs provided), or fall through to
the existing classifier on 1 match. `has_issues` flips True for every
new failure mode. Lock-test against `hallucinote_mcp.actions.browser._ROOTS`
prevents enum drift between the two sides. `format_requirements_md`
surfaces preset_query authoring issues in a dedicated section.

**R-2.2 — `docs/snapshot-schema.md` consolidated edit.** Documents:
loader's class-or-display-name dual accept (with the `Glue`/`Glue
Compressor` failing case named explicitly); `kind` field is
informational only (the loader ignores it); `preset_query.root` enum
enumerated inline with the `effects` vs `audio_effects` typo callout;
`path_prefix` must-be-list rule with wrong/right examples; "default
device vs named preset" subsection with both worked examples.

**Housekeeping.** `tests/unit/sync/test_pull.py::test_apply_device_parameters_property_round_trip`
gained `@settings(deadline=None)` — pre-existing hypothesis
`FlakyFailure` surfaced under parallel xdist contention; the test
checks correctness, not timing. Eight backlog items closed (cue
idempotency, default-scaffold cleanup, snapshot-schema gaps, `kind`
field documentation, default-vs-named preset doc, class-vs-display-name
doc, compat preset_query validation, first-push scaffold cleanup
offer) — `.prawduct/backlog.md` marked with RESOLVED / PARTIALLY
RESOLVED tags pointing at the chunk that closed them.

Suite: main 1758 (+31) + MCP 661 (+8) = 2419 passing, 0 failed.

## 2026-05-20 — v0.9.0 milestone: cross-machine portability + first tagged release

First user-facing tagged release. Bundles W13-B (missing-plugin detection
+ REQUIREMENTS.md + push preflight refuse-and-confirm), W13-C
(`docs/collaboration.md` walkthrough naming three portability cases), the
v0.9.0 CHANGELOG, and a hygiene sweep deleting four stale `.prawduct/`
investigation/triage artifacts (`bug-triage.md`, `bug-triage-wave2.md`,
`build-plan-wave-SD-paused.md`, `w12-a-investigation.md` — all covered
shipped work; git history preserves them).

New module `hallucinote.sync.compat` with five tagged status values
(`native`, `placeholder`, `third_party_ok`, `third_party_missing`,
`third_party_unverified`), nested-rack-recursive song walk, and a
`check | write-requirements` CLI surface. Push planner gains a clean
skip-with-warn for `kind='placeholder'` devices. The `/ableton-push`
skill adds Steps 0a (probe Live for installed plugins) and 0b (run
compat check, refuse-and-confirm on exit 1) before any push phase
fires. Express non-goal pinned in CHANGELOG: Hallucinote will never
substitute plugins or bundle audio.

W11 (inline `hallucinote://` DB read surface), W13-A (instrument
fallback identity — blocked on missing MCP `browser(search)` action),
and W16-A (assertions module) explicitly deferred to v1.0.

Suite 1510 → 1549 (+39 tests, ~11.8s). All four canary songs
(`falling-walking`, `full-band-rock`, `solo-piano-ambient`,
`odd-meter-experimental`) have REQUIREMENTS.md generated — all-native,
no install needed.

## 2026-05-17 — `arrangement` → `arrangement_clip` rename

DB table `arrangement` becomes `arrangement_clips`; indexes follow.
Mutators `add_arrangement` / `remove_arrangement` become
`add_arrangement_clip` / `remove_arrangement_clip` (kwarg
`arrangement_id` → `arrangement_clip_id`; payload key same). Event kinds
`ARRANGEMENT_ADDED` / `ARRANGEMENT_REMOVED` become
`ARRANGEMENT_CLIP_ADDED` / `ARRANGEMENT_CLIP_REMOVED` (constant + value
both move). Sync-layer link kind `"arrangement"` becomes
`"arrangement_clip"` in both `push._LINK_KINDS` and
`mutations.ABLETON_LINK_KINDS`; the planner key prefix on the
`batch_arrangement_layout` inner ops moves with it.

MCP-side `location='arrangement'` enum is **deliberately unchanged** —
it names Live's Arrangement *View*, per `docs/terminology.md`.

Latent footgun closed: `handlers/clip.py` `create_handler` for
`location='arrangement'` was returning `result["clip_index"] = i`, but
`_LINK_KINDS["arrangement_clip"]` expects `arrangement_clip_index`. The
mismatch silently dropped the `ableton_links` row the moment any
planner emitted `ableton_clip(create, location='arrangement', key='arrangement_clip:...')`.
No live consumer today (`batch_arrangement_layout`'s
`duplicate_to_arrangement_handler` already returned the right field) —
fix is forward-defensive.

Migration: `python tools/migrate_arrangement_clip.py <song.db>` —
single-transaction, idempotent. Renames table + 3 indexes, rewrites
`events.kind` (both kinds) + `events.payload_json.arrangement_id` →
`.arrangement_clip_id`, rewrites `ableton_links.db_kind`. Verified
round-trip against falling-walking's DB (32 placements + 32 events +
3 indexes rewritten; re-run is a clean no-op). The real
`songs/falling-walking/falling-walking.db` was migrated in place;
`build.py --reset` from the new schema is the alternative path.

Suite: 804/804 passing (no count change — pure refactor).

## 2026-05-17 — Install / uninstall skill cross-platform hardening

`hallucinote_mcp/src/hallucinote_mcp/install_paths.py` grew detection
helpers for User Library candidates (Windows OneDrive Documents
redirection, USERPROFILE divergence), installed Live versions, Live
process probing, `hallucinote-mcp` command resolution (PATH +
venv-bin/Scripts fallback, returning `(path, on_path)`), and MCP config
scanning across three scopes (project-local `.mcp.json`, global
top-level `~/.claude.json`, and the `projects.<cwd>.mcpServers` scope
that `claude mcp add` writes by default).

`python -m hallucinote_mcp.cli preflight` is a new CLI subcommand that
emits a JSON report consumed by both SKILL.md bodies — single source of
truth for install/uninstall detection. Both SKILL.md files rewritten to
drive off preflight: Claude Code now auto-detects Live state, User
Library location, installed Live versions, MCP config scope, and
malformed JSON instead of asking the user. Drift between SKILL.md copy
commands (rsync / robocopy / Copy-Item fallback) and `REMOTE_SCRIPT_EXCLUDE`
is now structurally enforced by `test_install_skill_consistency.py`.

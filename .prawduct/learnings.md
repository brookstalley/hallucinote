## Sync planner discipline

**When emitting a `ToolCall` for an MCP tool that has no `ALIASES_TODAY` entry, verify the actual MCP signature against the planner's args before considering the planner complete.**

The "canonical name + alias" pattern in `sync/mcp_names.py` is for tools that don't yet exist or need emulation; tools called directly (no alias) trust the planner to match the real signature. There's no schema check, no aliased emulator, no runtime mismatch — the call just fails at push time. Chunk 2 shipped a `plan_push_cue_points` that emitted `{time, name}` while real MCP `create_cue_point` takes `(bar: int 1-based, beat: float 0-based, name: str)`; the Critic caught it. Inspect the tool's MCP schema (via `ToolSearch` for `mcp__hallucinote-mcp__*`) when writing a planner for a directly-callable tool, and add a one-line signature note in `mcp_names.py` if absent.

## Detection that replaces a user question must enumerate every state

**When you refactor "ask the user X" into "detect X programmatically," the detector must enumerate every state the user would have known to mention — including the ones that look the same from outside.**

Conflating two states the consumer needs to distinguish is silently broken: the wrong branch fires, or no branch fires, with no error. The fix is shape, not effort: return a tagged value (tuple, dataclass, enum) so the consumer has to handle each state explicitly.

The install-skill hardening (PR #15) hit this twice in two Critic rounds:

- `hallucinote_mcp_command()` initially returned `Path | None`, conflating "found on PATH" with "found via venv fallback." The SKILL.md's tri-state branch — bare command vs absolute path in `.mcp.json` — was unreachable; venv-only installs would silently write a bare name that Claude Code couldn't launch. Fix: return `(path, on_path)` so the consumer must handle each case explicitly.
- `existing_mcp_config_files()` initially scanned only top-level `mcpServers`, missing `claude mcp add`'s default `projects.<cwd>.mcpServers` scope. A real, common registration shape was invisible to the uninstaller. Fix: scan all three scopes and tag each hit with a `json_pointer` so the consumer knows which scope to edit.

**Test discipline:** for each detection helper, write at least one test that distinguishes the conflated states (not just "found" vs "not found"). If you can't articulate the second state in a test, you haven't enumerated yet.

## Never use `is` for Live API object identity

**When a handler creates a Live API object and then needs to find its index or reference, NEVER scan for `obj is new_obj` against `song.X` / `track.X` — Live re-wraps API objects on every property access. The scan returns False even for the same underlying Live object, and the handler silently fails or returns a result missing a field.**

Fixes for the post-create resolution are deterministic-from-semantics: `len(song.X)` after an append, `insert_at + 1` for an insert, or a stable value match (e.g., `start_time` for arrangement clips, name + position for cues). Hit five times in one session (track / scene / return / clip-arrangement create handlers all had this shape; a sixth had it in cue_create's post-toggle scan). Each fix shipped with a regression test using a `_ReWrappingFake*` pattern that returns fresh Python wrappers on every `song.X` access — those tests pass with the fix and fail convincingly without it. **Make the wrapper-recreating fake a shared helper** in `hallucinote_mcp.testing` so future handlers can write the same regression in one line.

The fakes that DON'T simulate wrapper recreation still pass when `is` is used — that's why the bug existed for so long. Treat any fake that uses a plain `list.append(obj)` for a Live-collection-shaped attribute as suspect, because real Live's collection accessor returns a fresh wrapper sequence.

## Live API: trust the side effect, not the getter readback

**When writing a Live property (especially anything bound to transport — `current_song_time`, anything that affects the audio thread), do NOT verify success by reading the same property back in the same callback. Verify by inspecting the actual side effect (e.g., `song.cue_points` after a `set_or_delete_cue` toggle).**

`Song.current_song_time` (and likely other transport-coupled properties) is an audio-thread-mediated value. The setter completes synchronously on the main thread but the audio thread picks up the new value on the next audio buffer (~5-10ms). Within the same main-thread callback, the getter still returns the audio thread's last-flushed value — which is the OLD position. `Song.set_or_delete_cue()` reads the same audio-thread state, so it fires against the OLD position too unless wall-clock time passes between the write and the toggle.

**The fix that works**: `time.sleep(0.2)` between the write and the dependent operation. Main thread blocks; audio thread runs (separate OS thread, real-time priority, no GIL). After the sleep, the audio thread has the new value. Then trust the write — don't verify via the getter — and inspect the actual side effect (the cue list) to confirm success.

**What doesn't work**: `schedule_message(0, fn)` chains. Multiple deferred callbacks fire back-to-back within a single engine tick; no wall-clock time passes. The deferred-completion infrastructure (`DeferredCompletion`, `LiveContext.schedule_after_tick`) is still a useful primitive for other async patterns, but it doesn't solve cross-thread real-time settles.

**Diagnostic discipline**: when a handler writes a transport-coupled property, always include `target`, `last_observed`, and `prior` in any error response. The "each call observes the previous call's target" race pattern is visible in 30 seconds with these fields, invisible without them.

## Unit fakes that mirror an *assumed* Live API give false confidence

**Test fakes for Live's Remote Script API must simulate the real API's quirks — not the API's documented or assumed shape. Without an integration smoke test against a real Live process, the unit suite gives a green light to handlers that crash empirically.**

The 2026-05-17 push session shipped five handler fixes (B-1, B-2, B-10, B-11, B-12 in `bug-triage.md`) that each had passing unit tests. The fakes mirrored what we *thought* Live exposed: collection appends preserved identity, `set_or_delete_cue` accepted a time argument, `Track.load_device` existed, etc. Real Live 12.4 differs on every count. The unit suite never saw the divergence.

**Required for any handler that wraps a Live API operation**: at least one of (a) a fake that simulates the *quirk* (wrapper recreation, no-arg signatures, missing methods), or (b) an integration smoke test run against a real Live instance. Smoke tests cost ~30s wall-clock per release; they catch a class of bugs the unit suite literally cannot see.

Track potential smoke-test coverage in a `tests/integration/test_live_smoke.py` file. Don't gate on it for every PR (too slow); gate on it for "ready to release" / pre-merge of large refactors.

## Link, don't summarize

**When an artifact needs to reference a fact that lives in another artifact, file, or code path, link to the source — don't restate the fact in this artifact's prose.**

Restating creates a second source of truth that drifts independently. J-5 caught this concretely: `project-state.yaml` copied "hypothesis (parked in conftest.py, commented)" from `project-preferences.md` line 26 — but the preferences doc was itself already stale relative to `tests/conftest.py`, which had enabled Hypothesis in Wave M-4. One stale phrase → two stale artifacts; each maintenance pass that re-summarizes can compound the drift instead of resolving it. The same shape appeared in J-2 (`project-preferences.md` Test-location block contradicted its own Dev-commands block 18 lines down) and J-3 (the README rewrite verified each claim against `.mcp.json` / `pyproject.toml` / actual file paths rather than trusting the prior README). **When writing or auditing an artifact, treat any prose summary as suspicious if the underlying fact lives elsewhere.** Prefer "see `X` for current values" over restatement. Restate only invariants that can't be derived, and only at the canonical source-of-truth file. The corollary for audit chunks: re-read code, never trust prior summarizations of code.

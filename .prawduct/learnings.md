## Sync planner discipline

**When emitting a `ToolCall` for an MCP tool that has no `ALIASES_TODAY` entry, verify the actual MCP signature against the planner's args before considering the planner complete.**

The "canonical name + alias" pattern in `sync/mcp_names.py` is for tools that don't yet exist or need emulation; tools called directly (no alias) trust the planner to match the real signature. There's no schema check, no aliased emulator, no runtime mismatch — the call just fails at push time. Chunk 2 shipped a `plan_push_cue_points` that emitted `{time, name}` while real MCP `create_cue_point` takes `(bar: int 1-based, beat: float 0-based, name: str)`; the Critic caught it. Inspect the tool's MCP schema (via `ToolSearch` for `mcp__hallucinote-mcp__*`) when writing a planner for a directly-callable tool, and add a one-line signature note in `mcp_names.py` if absent.

## Detection that replaces a user question must enumerate every state

**When you refactor "ask the user X" into "detect X programmatically," the detector must enumerate every state the user would have known to mention — including the ones that look the same from outside.**

Conflating two states the consumer needs to distinguish is silently broken: the wrong branch fires, or no branch fires, with no error. The fix is shape, not effort: return a tagged value (tuple, dataclass, enum) so the consumer has to handle each state explicitly.

The install-skill hardening (PR #15) hit this twice in two Critic rounds:

- `hallucinote_mcp_command()` initially returned `Path | None`, conflating "found on PATH" with "found via venv fallback." The SKILL.md's tri-state branch — bare command vs absolute path in `.mcp.json` — was unreachable; venv-only installs would silently write a bare name that Claude Code couldn't launch. Fix: return `(path, on_path)` so the consumer must handle each case explicitly.
- `existing_mcp_config_files()` initially scanned only top-level `mcpServers`, missing `claude mcp add`'s default `projects.<cwd>.mcpServers` scope. A real, common registration shape was invisible to the uninstaller. Fix: scan all three scopes and tag each hit with a `json_pointer` so the consumer knows which scope to edit.

**Test discipline:** for each detection helper, write at least one test that distinguishes the conflated states (not just "found" vs "not found"). If you can't articulate the second state in a test, you haven't enumerated yet.

## Link, don't summarize

**When an artifact needs to reference a fact that lives in another artifact, file, or code path, link to the source — don't restate the fact in this artifact's prose.**

Restating creates a second source of truth that drifts independently. J-5 caught this concretely: `project-state.yaml` copied "hypothesis (parked in conftest.py, commented)" from `project-preferences.md` line 26 — but the preferences doc was itself already stale relative to `tests/conftest.py`, which had enabled Hypothesis in Wave M-4. One stale phrase → two stale artifacts; each maintenance pass that re-summarizes can compound the drift instead of resolving it. The same shape appeared in J-2 (`project-preferences.md` Test-location block contradicted its own Dev-commands block 18 lines down) and J-3 (the README rewrite verified each claim against `.mcp.json` / `pyproject.toml` / actual file paths rather than trusting the prior README). **When writing or auditing an artifact, treat any prose summary as suspicious if the underlying fact lives elsewhere.** Prefer "see `X` for current values" over restatement. Restate only invariants that can't be derived, and only at the canonical source-of-truth file. The corollary for audit chunks: re-read code, never trust prior summarizations of code.
